  <p>Hello gorgeous people, <strong>I’m Chloee Sioco</strong>, I’m a first-year Graphic Design student at <em>Algonquin College</em>. My love for art has been with me my whole life— it feels like this passion is imprinted in me. Growing up, I enthusiastically join poster-making competitions for every special occasion during my elementary and high school days. Winning didn’t matter to me; I simply enjoyed the process of creating and expressing myself. This deep-rooted passion I have for art inspired me to pursue a career in design because I believe this is where I can excel, explore various creative things, and truly be myself. My journey as an artist is driven by curiosity and a desire to follow what I love most: creating meaningful and impactful art. That being said, I’m excited to continue to grow as a designer, connecting with others through art and finding fresh approaches to bringing art to life. Here are some facts about me: I’m from the Philippines, I’m an artist specializing in personalized art, and I love my cats and dogs.</p>


  <p>The part of the lyrics that inspires me to keep me going:</p>
  <blockquote>"The struggles I'm facing. The chances I'm taking. Sometimes might knock me down, but No, I'm not breaking."</blockquote>
  <cite>– The Climb by Miley Cyrus</cite>
